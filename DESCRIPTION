    person(given = "John", 
           family = "Ferguson",

Description: Estimation and display of various types of population attributable 
    fraction and impact fractions. As well as the usual calculations of 
    attributable fractions and impact fractions, functions are provided for 
    attributable fraction nomograms and fan plots, continuous exposures, for 
    pathway specific population attributable fractions, and for joint, average 
    and sequential population attributable fractions.
