# graphPAF 3.0.0

# graphPAF 2.0.0

## Updates

v2.0.0
Added more functions, paf_levin and paf_miettinen to calculate PAF and confidence intervals for summary data.  Added print S3 methods for all individual data PAF functions.  Updated plotting functions to include arguments for controlling point, label, axis and title sizes.  Updated vignette extensively.

v1.0.2 
Updated vignette in multiple places to enhance readability (including being more prescriptive about arguments to various R functions).  Cosmetic changes have been made to the R code to ensure consistency of arguments across differing functions.

v1.0.1
Updates have been made to PAF_calc_continuous, PAF_calc_discrete, impact_fraction, ps_paf, joint_paf, average_paf and seq_paf to allow analysis of survey data. 


v1.0.0
This is the first version of graphPAF, a R package to calculate and display population attributable fractions. In addition to standard attributable fractions and impact fractions, graphPAF can compute attributable fraction nomograms and fanplots, attributable fractions for continuous exposures, pathway specific population attributable fractions and joint, sequential and average attributable fractions.  Causal structure can included in analyses via prior specification of a causal DAG.  See the vignette for an in-depth description of GraphPAF features.
